# Conventional Commit Format for GitHub Copilot

## Rules

1. Use `type` from: `feat`, `fix`, `docs`, `chore`, `refactor`, `test`, `perf`, `ci`, `build`.
2. `scope` should be the affected module or feature (e.g., `auth`, `UI`, `API`).
3. `message` should be **short and meaningful** (max 50 characters).
4. **Issue number is required** at the end: `(#123)`, extracted from the branch name.

## Examples

✅ `feat(auth): add Google login (#123)`
✅ `fix(ui): fix navbar alignment issue (#456)`
✅ `docs(readme): update API documentation (#789)`

## Additional Rules

- Start with a lowercase verb (`add`, `fix`, `update`, `refactor`).
- Keep the commit message concise.
- If multiple changes, separate them with `;` (e.g., `fix(auth): resolve login issue; improve error handling (#101)`).

## Extracting Issue Number

- If the branch follows the format `feature/#123-login`, the commit message should end with `(#123)`.
- If no issue number is found in the branch, Copilot should ask for it.

## Commit Messages to Avoid

❌ `added new feature` (Too generic, missing type)
❌ `fix` (Missing description and issue number)
❌ `update docs` (Unclear, missing scope and issue number)
